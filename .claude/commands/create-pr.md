# Create Pull Request for Claude Code Sound Themes

Creates a pull request with intelligent analysis of changes and customized descriptions based on the type of contribution (theme, code, documentation).

## Usage

- `/project:create-pr` - Analyze changes and create PR with appropriate description
- `/project:create-pr "Custom PR title"` - Create PR with custom title

## Current Environment

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Uncommitted changes: !`git diff --name-only`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --name-only`
- Recent commits on branch: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Compare with main: !`git diff main...HEAD --name-only`

## Arguments

Custom PR title: $ARGUMENTS

## Pre-Flight Validation

The command performs comprehensive validation before creating the PR:

### 1. **Sensitive File Detection**
Warns if these sensitive files are modified:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Technical documentation (requires careful review)
- `.claude/commands/*` - Slash commands (potential security implications)
- `settings-template.json` - Core configuration template
- `themed-sound-player.sh` - Core script (extensive testing required)

### 2. **Contribution Type Analysis**
Automatically detects contribution type based on changed files:

**Theme Contribution**: New or modified files in `sound-themes/`
- Validates theme structure and naming conventions
- Checks for required README.md files
- Verifies sound file naming patterns (`name-volume.extension`)
- Ensures proper directory structure (default/, stop/, bash/, etc.)

**Code Contribution**: Changes to core scripts or commands
- Validates bash syntax where applicable
- Checks for breaking changes
- Warns about cross-platform compatibility requirements

**Documentation Contribution**: Changes to .md files
- Validates markdown structure
- Checks for consistency with existing docs

### 3. **Quality Checks**
- Ensures proper git workflow (feature branch, not main)
- Validates commit messages follow project standards
- Checks for untracked files that should be included
- Verifies no sensitive information is accidentally committed

## PR Creation Process

### 1. **Branch Management**
- Ensures you're on a feature branch (not main)
- Creates feature branch if needed: `feature/contribution-type-timestamp`
- Pushes branch to origin with tracking

### 2. **Change Analysis**
Analyzes all changes since diverging from main branch:
- Categorizes files by type (theme, code, docs)
- Identifies new themes vs modifications
- Detects potential breaking changes
- Counts files and lines changed

### 3. **PR Description Generation**
Creates customized PR descriptions based on contribution type:

**For Theme Contributions**:
```markdown
